#The Dignifier
-----------------------------------------------------

Using Kyle McDonald's ofxFaceTracker library, I'm 
going to dignify all the peoples! #Get Dignified!

-----------------------------------------------------

Included in this folder is the openFrameworks version
used to run ofxFaceTracker, since it's quite picky 
about the version, as well as the different addons 
needed to run the code.

The Dignifier is located in the apps/myApps folder.

-----------------------------------------------------

Pseudo Code

    main.cpp 
	ofApp.cpp 

        // load face tracker
        // grab beard and position

	ofApp.h 

        // variables for images
        // variables for vector points
